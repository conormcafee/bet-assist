#Introduction

This project is aimed at assiting football betting choices for those who enjot a bet at the weekend. I am using [https://www.football-data.org/](https://www.football-data.org/)'s API to return the data, then making the most of my JavaScript skills to analayse the data as much as I can to make betting choices easier. You can follow progress on here, where features will be tracked and managed in the `Issues` tab. Master branch will be published here: [Bet Assist](https://bet-assist.netlify.com/).
